# Install content authoring tools

This article describes the steps to interactively install Git client tools and Visual Studio Code.
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
> * Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
> * Install [Docs Authoring Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=docsmsft.docs-authoring-pack)

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If you're making only minor changes to an article, you *do not* need to complete the steps in this article and can continue directly to the [quick changes workflow](index.md#quick-edits-to-existing-documents).
>
> Contributors who will be making major changes are encouraged to complete these steps, which enable you to use the [major/long-running changes workflow](how-to-write-workflows-major.md). Even if you have write permissions in the main repository, *we highly recommend (and this guide assumes) that you fork and clone the repository*, so that you have read/write permissions to store your proposed changes in your fork.

## Install Git client tools

This install includes the Git version control system and Git Bash, the command-line app that you use to interact with your local Git repository.

### Install Git client tools for Windows

* Git for Mac is provided as part of the Xcode Command Line Tools. Simply run `git` from the command line. You will be prompted to install the command line tools if needed. You can also download [Git for Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) from the Software Freedom Conservancy.
* [Git for Linux and Unix](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

Follow the instructions for your chosen client for installation and configuration.

## Install Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), also known as VS Code, is a lightweight editor that works on Windows, Linux, and Mac. It includes git integration, and support for extensions.

> [!TIP]
> To launch VS Code and open the current folder, run the command `code .` in the command line or bash shell. If the current folder is part of a local git repo, the GitHub integration appears in Visual Studio Code automatically.

### Install Visual Studio Code for Window, mac and Linux

- [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The VS Code home page should detect your operating system correctly.
- [Mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)
- [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)

## Install Visual Studio Code extensions

### Install Docs Authoring Pack

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Docs Authoring Pack for Visual Studio Code includes basic Markdown authoring assistance, page previews, support for Markdown templates, markdownlint, and Code Spell Checker. These features ease and streamline the contributions process. As such, we consider the Docs Authoring Pack a **required** extension for contributors.

To install the Docs Authoring Pack, choose **Install** from the [Docs Authoring Pack page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=docsmsft.docs-authoring-pack) in the VS Code Marketplace.

To use the Docs Authoring Pack functionality, press Alt+M in Visual Studio Code. To configure a toolbar to show the functions available, edit the Visual Studio Code settings (Control+comma), and add user setting `"markdown.showToolbar": true`.

For more information, see [Docs Authoring Pack for Visual Studio Code](how-to-write-docs-auth-pack.md).

## Understand Markdown editors

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to author the content. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the preferred tool for editing Markdown at Microsoft. [Atom](https://atom.io) is another popular tool for editing Markdown. Markdown basics and the features supported by Open Publishing Services (OPS) custom Markdown extensions, are covered in the [Markdown Reference](markdown-reference.md) article.
