# Contributing to PowerShell documentation

The Contributor's Guide is a collection of articles that explain the tools and processes we use to
create documentation at Microsoft. Some of these guides cover information that is common to any
documentation set published to docs.microsoft.com. Some of the guides are specific to how we write
documentation for PowerShell.

The common articles are available in this centralized Contributor's Guide. The
[PowerShell Contributor Guide](/powershell/scripting/community/contributing/overview) is available
Community section of the PowerShell documentation.
