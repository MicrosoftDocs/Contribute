# Learn how to contribute to the .NET docs repositories

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the .NET documentation!

This document covers the process for contributing to the articles and code samples that are hosted on the [.NET documentation site](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet). Contributions may be as simple as typo corrections or as complex as new articles.

The .NET documentation site is built from multiple repositories:

- [.NET conceptual articles](https://github.com/dotnet/docs)
- [Code samples and snippets](https://github.com/dotnet/samples)
- [.NET API reference](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs)
- [.NET Compiler Platform SDK reference](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-api-docs)
- [ML.NET API reference](https://github.com/dotnet/ml-api-docs)
