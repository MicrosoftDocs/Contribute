## Warning

<https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/metadata-changes?branch=main>
`Both ms.prod and ms.service can't be specified. Use ms.prod for on-premise products, orÂ ms.service for cloud services.`

## Resolution

Either `ms.prod` or `ms.service` is required, and they can't both be present: `ms.prod` is used for on-premises products; `ms.service` is used for cloud services. Determine which is appropriate for your article, verify that the value is correct, and remove the other field.

Valid values can be found on [this Microsoft-internal site](https://docsmetadatatool.azurewebsites.net/allowlists). To request new values, follow [this process](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/metadata-changes?branch=main).
