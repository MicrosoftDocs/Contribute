# h1-blank

## Warning

`H1 is required. Add content to your top-level heading.`

H1 refers to the first heading in a Markdown file. When published to docs.microsoft.com, the H1 shows at the top of the page in a large font. An H1 is created by beginning a line with a single hash (#) followed by a space, then the heading text.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, make sure your H1 includes content, not just a hash.

Bad:

```markdown
---
author: meganbradley
ms.author: mbradley
---
#
This is not an H1
```

Good:

```markdown
---
author: meganbradley
ms.author: mbradley
---
# This is an H1
```
