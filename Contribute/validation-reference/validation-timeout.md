## Warning

`The call to the validation service timed out and validation was not completed. This happens when there's an issue with the service and continuing to retry the call could cause build delays. You might have content issues that were not reported. To retry validation, close and re-open your PR, or force a full build of your branch via https://ops.microsoft.com. Note that forcing a full build requires admin permissions to the repo. If you donâ€™t know who your repo admin is, or if you continue to see this message after a forced build, file an issue via https://SiteHelp.`

Sometimes transient issues in the validation service, such as a server in a bad state, prevent Docs Build from successfully calling the service. After several tries, the call times out and validation is canceled to avoid build delays and clogging the build pipeline.

## Resolution

Try closing and re-opening your PR, or forcing a full build via [Docs Portal](https://ops.microsoft.com/#/). Often service issues clear themselves up after the initial retry.

Note that you must be a repo admin to force a build via Docs Portal. If you don't know who your repo admin is, or if you continue to get this message after a forced build, file an issue via [https://SiteHelp](https://SiteHelp) if you're a Microsoft employee, or @ mention the author of an article in your PR for assistance if you're an external contributor.

If you're a repo admin, you can force a full build as follows:

1. Go to [Docs Portal](https://ops.microsoft.com/#/) and sign in.
1. Find your repo by searching in the upper left corner, and select it.

   :::image type="content" source="media/find-repo.png" alt-text="find your repo via the Docs Portal search box":::
1. On the **Build History** tab, click **+ Manual Publish**.
1. Select the branch that's getting the Warning, such as main.
1. For target, keep the default, **Docs Site**.
1. Check the **Force Publish** checkbox.
1. Click **Publish**.

This will force a full build on the branch.
