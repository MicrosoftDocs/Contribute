# no-space-in-h1

## Warning

`A space is required after the hash (#) in H1.`

H1 refers to the first heading in a Markdown file. When published to docs.microsoft.com, the H1 shows at the top of the page in a large font. An H1 is created by beginning a line with a single hash (#) followed by a space, then the heading text. Without the space after the hash, Docs will not recognize an H1.

## Resolution

To fix this error, add a space after the hash in your H1.

```markdown

# This is an H1
```
