# Docs validation reference

The articles in this section provide information about Errors, Warnings, and Suggestions you might see when submitting a PR to a learn.microsoft.com repo, or when building a repo to publish to learn.microsoft.com.

Note that not all issues will be enabled on all repos; some are specific to certain content sets. Fix the issues listed in your build report, not every issue described in this reference.

Also note that this reference is not complete - new articles will be added and linked from build report error codes as an ongoing effort. Although build reports are public, some of the information required to fix some issues is not available outside of Microsoft. If you can't find documentation for an Error or Warning, if the message or documentation isn't clear, or if you're a non-Microsoft contributor and can't access additional information, use the documentation feedback button below to file a GitHub issue.
