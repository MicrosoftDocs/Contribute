# multiple-h1

## Warning

`Multiple H1s are not allowed. You can only have one top-level heading.`

H1 refers to the first heading in a Markdown file. When published to docs.microsoft.com, the H1 shows at the top of the page in a large font. An H1 is created by beginning a line with a single hash (#) followed by a space, then the heading text. You can only have one H1 in each file.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, change the heading level of subsequent H1s to H2 (`##`), or otherwise reorganize your file. Note that skipping heading levels, such as following H1 with H3, is not allowed.
