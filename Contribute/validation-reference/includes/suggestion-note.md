> [!IMPORTANT]
> This rule is initially enabled as a "Suggestion" to give content teams a time to gauge impact and develop a plan to clean up their repos. Unlike Errors, which block the Docs build, and Warnings, which can affect workflow automation, Suggestions don't require immediate action, but you should fix them as soon as possible because at some point they will be elevated to Warnings or Errors. Details about when the severity will change and to what will be included in the message when available.
>
> If you have questions or concerns about cleaning up Suggestions, file a GitHub issue using the link at the bottom of this article.
