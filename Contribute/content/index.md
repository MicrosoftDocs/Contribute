# Contribute to the Microsoft Learn platform

Welcome to the Microsoft Learn contributor guide! This documentation introduces you to the ways you can contribute to the Microsoft Learn platform and teaches you how to get started.

Microsoft Learn hosts all documentation for Microsoft products and technologies. Sharing your expertise with others on Microsoft Learn helps everyone achieve more. Use the information in this guide to publish a new article to Microsoft Learn, update a published article, answer questions on Microsoft Q&A, and more.

## Who can contribute?

Anyone who desires to share their knowledge and make a difference can contribute to Microsoft Learn! If you have expertise to share, you're in the right place.

This guide is intended for any non-Microsoft employee who wants to contribute their knowledge to the content and experiences on Microsoft Learn. (Are you a Microsoft employee? Use our internal [content contributor guides](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/help) instead.)

## How do I start?

> [!TIP]
> A self-paced, [step-by-step learning path](/training/modules/become-learn-contributor) is available for this topic.

First, set up a few accounts. You'll need a [GitHub account](#create-a-github-account) or a [Microsoft account](#create-a-microsoft-account), depending on how you want to participate. The following table shows your contribution options and the type of account you'll need.

Once you've set up your accounts, select a contribution option from the table to learn more about how to get started.

### Create a GitHub account

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) for a fast and free sign-up process.
1. In your GitHub profile, identify your affiliations, like professional organizations you belong to or credentials/certifications you've earned. Contributions to Microsoft Learn count toward [MVP award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/) consideration. Identification helps us build a complete profile of all your activities.
