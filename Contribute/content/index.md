# Contribute to the Microsoft Learn platform

Welcome to the Microsoft Learn contributor guide! This documentation introduces you the ways you can contribute to the Microsoft Learn platform and teaches you how to get started.

Microsoft Learn hosts all documentation for Microsoft products and technologies. Sharing your expertise with others on Microsoft Learn helps everyone achieve more. Use the information in this guide to publish a new article to Microsoft Learn, update a published article, answer questions on Microsoft Q&A, and more.

## Who can contribute?

You, your parent, your sibling, your best friend -- anyone can contribute to Microsoft Learn! If you have expertise to share, you're in the right place.

This guide is intended for any non-Microsoft employee who wants to contribute their knowledge to the content and experiences on Microsoft Learn. (If you're a Microsoft employee, use our internal [content contributor guides](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/help) instead.)

## How do I start?

First, set up a few accounts. You'll need a [GitHub account](#set-up-a-github-account) or a [Microsoft account](#set-up-a-microsoft-account), depending on how you want to participate. The following table shows your contribution options and the type of account you'll need.

Once you've set up your accounts, select a contribution option from the table to learn more about how to get started.

|Contribution option  |Account required  |
|---------|---------|
|[Edit documentation](how-to-write-overview.md)     | GitHub         |
|[Review pull requests](how-to-review-pull-request.md)     | GitHub         |
|[Create GitHub issues](how-to-create-github-issues.md)     | GitHub         |
|[Answer questions on Microsoft Q&A](qna-overview.md)     | Microsoft        |

### Create a GitHub account

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) for a fast and free sign-up process.
1. In your GitHub profile, identify your affiliations, like professional organizations you belong to or credentials/certifications you've earned. Contributions to Microsoft Learn count toward [MVP award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/) consideration. Identification helps us build a complete profile of all your activities.

>[!NOTE]
> Microsoft employees participating in Open Source projects always identify themselves as such in their GitHub profiles. Community contributors should ensure that their profile does not incorrectly imply an employment relationship.

### Create a Microsoft account

1. Navigate to [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/).
1. Select **Sign in** in the upper-right corner.
1. Follow the prompts to create a Microsoft account and profile.
1. Once created, visit [Managing your Microsoft Learn profile settings](/training/support/learn-profile-manage) to learn how to update your Microsoft Learn profile.

## What's in it for me?

Contributing to Microsoft Learn benefits not only our learners but also YOU! When you edit documentation, your name appears in the list of contributors at the top of the article. Your commits to our GitHub repositories will show up in your GitHub commit history, which is a great way to demonstrate your passion for a particular technology while also building your portfolio. For some products, you can earn digital swag too, like badges.
