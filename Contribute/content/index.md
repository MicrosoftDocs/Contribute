# Contribute to the Microsoft Learn platform

Welcome to the Microsoft Learn contributor guide! This documentation introduces you the ways you can contribute to the Microsoft Learn platform and teaches you how to get started.

Sharing your expertise with others on Microsoft Learn helps everyone achieve more. Use the information in this guide to publish a new article to Microsoft Learn, update a published article, answer questions on Microsoft Q&A, and more.

## Who can contribute?
Microsoft Learn hosts all documentation for Microsoft products and technologies.”
You, your parent, your sibling, your best friend -- anyone can contribute to Microsoft Learn! If you have expertise to share, you're in the right place.

This guide is intended for any non-Microsoft employee who wants to contribute their knowledge to the content and experiences on Microsoft Learn. (If you're a Microsoft employee, use our internal [content contributor guides](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/help) instead.)

## How do I start?

First, set up a few accounts. You'll need a [GitHub account](#set-up-a-github-account) or a [Microsoft account](#set-up-a-microsoft-account), depending on how you want to participate. The following table shows your contribution options and the type of account you'll need.

Once you've set up your accounts, select a contribution option from the table to learn more about how to get started.

## What's in it for me?

Contributing to Microsoft Learn benefits not only our learners but also YOU! When you edit documentation, your name appears in the list of contributors at the top of the article. Your commits to our GitHub repositories will show up in your GitHub commit history, which is a great way to demonstrate your passion for a particular technology while also building your portfolio. For some products, you can earn digital swag too, like badges.
