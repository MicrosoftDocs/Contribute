# Markdown and YML templates for solution ideas

Alternatively, you can email us a Word document of your architecture, using the Solution Idea Word template. Send the draft of your article to [AACProposals@microsoft.com](mailto:AACProposals@microsoft.com). The Word template is coming soon.

Use these Markdown and YML templates to create a solution idea architecture.

Each article must have two files: YML and MD.

## YML file

Name this file *\<solution-idea>.yml*:

```yml
### YamlMime:Architecture
metadata:
  title: <Article title, which becomes the title metadata>
  titleSuffix: Azure Architecture Center
  description: <Write a 100-160 character description that ends with a period and starts with a verb. This becomes the browse card description.>
  author: <Your GitHub username>
  ms.date: <Publish or major update date - mm/dd/yyyy>
  ms.topic: conceptual
  ms.service: architecture-center
  ms.subservice: solution-idea
azureCategories:
  - <Include at least one category, such as ai-machine-learning, analytics, compute, containers, databases, devops, hybrid, identity, integration, iot, networking, security, storage, and web>
  - <There can be more than one category>
products:
  - <Choose 1-5 products, such as azure-active-directory, azure-app-service, azure-arc, azure-cosmos-db, azure-data-factory, azure-data-lake, azure-devops, azure-event-hubs, azure-firewall, azure-functions, azure-hdinsight, azure-iot, azure-sql-database, azure-storage, and azure-virtual-machines. If your product is not included here, inquire with our AAC team.>
  - <Second product. Include 1-5 products--no more than 5!>
name: <The H1 title is a phrase with a present tense verb that describes the scenario (no gerunds, "-ing" verbs). Example: "Use Azure monitoring to integrate security components">
summary: <Write a summary. Can be same as description.>
thumbnailUrl: /azure/architecture/browse/thumbs/<browse-png-filename>.png
content: |
  [!include[](<solution-idea>-content.md)]
```

Notes:

* Make sure you copy the main diagram image into the `/azure/architecture/browse/thumbs` folder.
* Update the YML file with the new thumbnail path for the `thumbnailUrl` field.
* In the [TOC file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/architecture-center/blob/main/docs/toc.yml), add a link to this new YML file. Place the link in one of the Azure categories (such as "AI + Machine Learning"), under its "Solution ideas" section. We list the Solution ideas alphabetically.

## MD file

Name this file *\<solution-idea-content>.md* (do not use acronyms or capitals in the filename):

```markdown

> The H1 title is a noun phrase with a present tense verb that describes the scenario (no gerunds, "-ing" verbs). Don't enter it here, but as the **name** value in the corresponding YML file.> 
> Include the solution idea header note at the top of the solution idea. This adds clarification why this is a scaled-back architecture (and provides consistency with our other SIs)...

[!INCLUDE [header_file](../../../includes/sol-idea-header.md)]

> Introductory section - no heading
>> In this section, include 1-2 sentences to briefly explain this architecture. 
>> The full scenario info will go in the "Scenario details" section, which is below the "Architecture" H2 (top level) heading, below the "Components" H3 header, and above the "Contributors" H2 (top level) header. That includes the "Potential use cases" H3 section, which goes under the "Scenario details" H2 section. The reason why we moved this content down lower, is because customers want the emphasis on the diagram and architecture first, not the scenario.

## Architecture

> Architecture diagram goes here. Use the following format:

![Diagram of the <solution name> architecture.](./images/<file-name>.png)

> Under the architecture diagram, include this sentence and a link to the Visio file or the PowerPoint file: 

*Download a [Visio file](https://arch-center.azureedge.net/[file-name].vsdx) of this architecture.*

> Note that you must send the Visio or PowerPoint file to the AAC contact.

### Dataflow

> An alternate title for this sub-section is "Workflow" (if data isn't really involved).
> In this section, include a numbered list that annotates/describes the dataflow or workflow through the solution. Explain what each step does. Start from the user or external data source, and then follow the flow through the rest of the solution (as shown in the diagram).

Examples:
1. Admin 1 adds, updates, or deletes an entry in Admin 1's fork of the Microsoft 365 config file.
2. Admin 1 commits and syncs the changes to Admin 1's forked repository.
3. Admin 1 creates a pull request (PR) to merge the changes to the main repository.
4. The build pipeline runs on the PR.

### Components

> A bullet list of components in the architecture (including all relevant Azure services) with links to the product service pages on Azure.com.

> Why is each component there?
> What does it do and why was it necessary?
> Link the name of the service (via embedded link) to the service's product service page. Be sure to exclude the localization part of the URL (such as "en-US/").

Example: 
* [Resource Groups][resource-groups] is a logical container for Azure resources.  We use resource groups to organize everything related to this project in the Azure console.

## Scenario details

> This should be an explanation of the business problem and why this scenario was built to solve it.
>> What prompted them to solve the problem?
>> What services were used in building out this solution?
>> What does this example scenario show? What are the customer's goals?

> What were the benefits of implementing the solution?

### Potential use cases

> What industry is the customer in? Use the following industry keywords, when possible, to get the article into the proper search and filter results: retail, finance, manufacturing, healthcare, government, energy, telecommunications, education, automotive, nonprofit, game, media (media and entertainment), travel (includes hospitality, like restaurants), facilities (includes real estate), aircraft (includes aerospace and satellites), agriculture, and sports. 
>> Are there any other use cases or industries where this would be a fit?
>> How similar or different are they to what's in this article?

## Contributors


> Start with the explanation text (same for every section), in italics. Then include the "Principal authors" list and the "Other contributors" list, if there are additional contributors (all in plain text, not italics or bold). Link each contributor's name to the person's LinkedIn profile. After the name, place a pipe symbol ("|") with spaces, and then enter the person's title. We don't include the person's company, MVP status, or links to additional profiles. Implement this format:

*This article is maintained by Microsoft. It was originally written by the following contributors.*

Principal authors: > Only the primary authors. Listed alphabetically by last name. Use this format: Fname Lname. If the article gets rewritten, keep the original authors and add in the new one(s).

 - [Author 1 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | (Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect")
 - [Author 2 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | (Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect")
 - > Continue for each primary author (even if there are 10 of them).

Other contributors: > (If applicable.) Include contributing (but not primary) authors, major editors (not minor edits), and technical reviewers. Listed alphabetically by last name. Use this format: Fname Lname. It's okay to add in newer contributors.

 - [Contributor 1 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | (Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect")
 - [Contributor 2 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | (Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect")
 - > Continue for each additional contributor (even if there are 10 of them).

*To see non-public LinkedIn profiles, sign in to LinkedIn.*

## Next steps

> Links to articles on Microsoft Learn. The links could also be to appropriate sources outside of Microsoft Learn, such as third-party documentation, GitHub repos, or an official technical blog post.

Examples:

* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) documentation](/azure/aks)
* [Azure Machine Learning documentation](/azure/machine-learning)
* [What are Azure Cognitive Services?](/azure/cognitive-services/what-are-cognitive-services)

## Related resources

> Link to articles in the AAC repo. The links should be relative, such as (../../solution-ideas/articles/<article-name>.yml).
