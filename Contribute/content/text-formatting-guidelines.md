# Text formatting guidelines

Consistent and appropriate use of bold, italic, and code style for text elements improves readability and helps avoid misunderstandings. If a text formatting element isn't covered by this guidance, refer to the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](/style-guide/welcome/). The following articles provide detailed guidance on text formatting:

- [Formatting common text elements](/style-guide/text-formatting/formatting-common-text-elements)

- [Formatting text in instructions](/style-guide/procedures-instructions/formatting-text-in-instructions)

- [Formatting common developer elements](/style-guide/developer-content/formatting-developer-text-elements)

## UI elements

UI elements, like menu items, dialog names, and names of text boxes, should be in bold text.

- **This**: In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project node, and then select **Add** > **New Item**.

- **Not this**: In Solution Explorer, right-click the project node, and then select Add > New Item.

## Git repo and branch names

Use bold text for Git repo or branch names when selected or entered in instructions.

- **This**: From the branch menu, select **main**.

- **Not this**: From the branch menu, select "main".

## New term introductions

Use italic text to introduce a new term along with a definition or explanation. Italicize the new term the first time you use it, and then use regular text for the definition or explanation.

- **This**: In App Service, an app runs in an *App Service plan*. An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run on.

- **Not this**: In App Service, an app runs in an "App Service plan." An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run on.

## Code style

Use code style for:

* Code elements, such as method names, property names, and language keywords.
* SQL commands
* NuGet package names
* Command-line commands\*
* Database table and column names
* Resource names that should not be localized (such as virtual machine names)
* URLs that you don't want to be clickable

**Why?** Some style guides specify bold for many of these text elements. However, most articles are localized, and code style tells the translator to leave that part of the text untranslated.

Code style can be *inline* (surrounded by \`) or *fenced* code blocks (surrounded by \`\`\`) that span multiple lines. Put longer code snippets and paths in fenced code blocks.

\* In command-line commands, use forward slashes in file paths if they're supported on all platforms. Use backslashes to illustrate commands that run on Windows, when only backslashes are supported. For example, forward slashes work on the .NET CLI on all platforms, so you would use `dotnet build foldername/filename.csproj` rather than `dotnet build foldername\filename.csproj`.

### Examples using inline styles

* **This**: By default, the Entity Framework interprets a property that's named `Id` or `ClassnameID` as the primary key.
* **Not this**: By default, the Entity Framework interprets a property that's named *Id* or *ClassnameID* as the primary key.
* **This**: The `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package provides runtime support for EF Core.
* **Not this**: The *Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore* package provides runtime support for EF Core.

### Examples of fenced code blocks

* **This**: No commands are sent to the database by statements that just change an `IQueryable`, such as the following code:

  ```markdown
      ```csharp
      var students = context.Students.Where(s => s.LastName == "Davolio")
      ```
  ```

* **Not this**: No commands are sent to the database by statements that just change an **IQueryable**, such as **var students = context.Students.Where(s => s.LastName == "Davolio")**.

* **This**: For example, to run the `Get-ServiceLog.ps1` script in the `C:\Scripts` directory, type:

  ```markdown
      ```powershell
      C:\Scripts\Get-ServiceLog.ps1
      ```
  ```

* **Not this**: For example, to run the **Get-ServiceLog.ps1** script in the **C:\Scripts** directory, type: "C:\Scripts\Get-ServiceLog.ps1."

* **All** fenced code blocks must have an approved language tag. For a list of support language tags, see [How to include code in docs](./code-in-docs.md#supported-languages).

## Placeholders

In paragraph text or procedural steps, use italic for placeholder text that users will substitute with their own information.

- **This**: Enter *password*

- **Not this**: Enter "password"

- **This**: Enter **-p** *password*

- **Not this**: Enter **-p** password

If you want the user to replace part of an input string with their own values, use placeholder text marked off by angle brackets (less than  `<` and greater than `>` characters). 

**Option 1:** Use code-styling to surround the placeholder word or the encompassing phrase. For example, you can use single backticks \` for inline-code formatting for a single phrase, or triple-ticks \`\`\` for code-fenced formatting.

```markdown
`az group delete -n <ResourceGroupName>`
```

Rendered as:
> `az group delete -n <ResourceGroupName>`

or

**Option 2:** Use a backslash character `\` to escape the angle bracket characters in Markdown, such as `\<` and `\>`. While only the first escape on the left angle bracket `\<` is required, escaping the closing bracket `\>` works too for consistency. The rendered HTML doesn't show the escape character to the reader:

```markdown
az group delete -n \<ResourceGroupName\>
```

Rendered as:
>  az group delete -n \<ResourceGroupName\>


**Inform the reader about the placeholder**: In the text that precedes placeholder examples, explain to the reader that the text in brackets must be removed and substituted with real values. We recommend the use of italics for user input. You can format italics within angle bracketed inline code:

> In the following example, replace the placeholder text *`<ResourceGroupName>`* with your own resource group name.

> [!CAUTION]
> The Microsoft Learn site does not render \<placeholder\> text that uses angle brackets in cases where the brackets are not escaped properly or the text is not code-formatted. The Microsoft Learn build process interprets the \<placeholder\> phrase as an HTML tag that could be dangerous to the reader's browser, and flags it as a *disallowed-html-tag*. You'll see a suggestion in the build report, and the placeholder word isn't rendered in the Microsoft Learn page output when that happens.
>  
> To avoid content loss on placeholders, use `code` formatting or  escape characters (`\<` `\>`)  as described previously.

We discourage using curly braces { } as syntactical placeholders. Readers can confuse curly brace placeholders with the same notation used in:

* Replaceable text
* Format strings
* String interpolation
* Text templates
* Similar programming constructs

**Casing and spacing**: You can separate placeholder names with hyphens ("kebab case") or with underscores, or you can do it by using Pascal case. Kebab case might generate syntax errors, and underscores could conflict with underlining. Use of all caps can conflict with named constants in many languages, though it may also draw attention to the placeholder name.

> *`<Resource-Group-Name>`* or *`<ResourceGroupName>`*

## Headings

Don't apply an inline style like italic, bold, or inline code style to headings.

**Why?** Headings have their own styles, and mixing other styles creates inconsistencies.

- **This**: Import the Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions package

- **Not this**: Import the *Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions* package

## Link text

Don't apply inline style like italic or bold to link text. 

**Why?** People rely on standard hyperlink text to identify text elements as clickable links. Styling a link as italic, for example, can obscure the fact that the text is a link.

- **This**: The NuGet package [Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions) generates the function.json file.

**Not this**: The NuGet package *[Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions)* generates the function.json file.

## Keys and keyboard shortcuts

When referring to keys or key combinations, follow these conventions:

* Capitalize the first letter of key names.
* Surround the key names with `<kbd>` and `</kbd>` HTML tags.
* Use "+" to join keys that the user selects at the same time.

### Examples of keys and keyboard shortcuts

* **This**: Select <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>.
* **Not this**: Press **ALT+CTRL+S**.
* **Not this**: Hit `ALT+CTRL+S`.

## Exceptions

Consistent style guidelines create a reliable customer experience and simplify the authoring process. Exceptions to these guidelines must be considered carefully. 

If the exception involves using an alternate text style that normally calls for code, make sure it's OK to translate the text in localized versions of the article. For scenarios where you want to prevent localization without using code style, see [Non-localized strings](/contribute/content/markdown-reference).
