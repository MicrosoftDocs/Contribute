Create and manage Microsoft Learn Collections
---
Microsoft Learn Collections is a feature available to anyone with a Microsoft Learn profile. Collections allow you to create curated lists of Microsoft Learn content to share with your followers. A collection can include documentation articles, training modules, learning paths, videos, code samples, and more.
---
With collections
you can:
|
    "- Bookmark useful content that you need to reference often.
|
        "- Bookmark interesting content that you don't have time to read right now and want to revisit later.
|
        "- Curate content to share with your employees, students, followers, or community. In this case, plan what content you'll save to the collection and how you'll organize it before you create it.
Create a collection
You can create a collection from your profile page 
        or from the content page of any Microsoft 
        Learn item.
Before building your collection,
        be clear about its purpose and what
        action you want the viewers to take
        Prepare the different elements of the collection
        ahead of time. Use a short
        descriptive title that summarizes the 
        topic covered in the collection 
        Add a description of what’s included in the collection 
        so that the viewer understands its 
        purpose and what action you’re suggesting
        they take by accessing the collection 
        You can edit the title and description of
        the collection at any time

## Add and manage content

    
The Collections feature supports all content types. Once you've created a collection, you can add any content from the Microsoft Learn site to the collection by selecting the **Save** button available on all pages. Once added, you can [rearrange](#rearrange-content) and [delete](#delete-content) content as needed.
Other considerations for adding content to a collection include:
- Limit the number
of items in the collection to fewer than
10 items.
Three to five items is ideal.
- The first item will get the most engagement, followed by positions
two     
and 
three.
- The items in positions 
four through
ten will receive more engagement
if the sections are used.
- Sort sections and items in the order you recommend the user consume 
them.

## Share a collection
Sharing a collection with your
followers or colleagues allows you to show
others the content you've curated. You can
share a collection with anyone, even if they do not have a Microsoft Learn account.

You can share your 
collection by copying the URL from the browser, or 
by using the *Share* functionality 
from within the collection itself.

### Share from the browser

1. Navigate to the collection
you would like to share.
1. Copy the link in the URL bar of 
your browser.
>[!IMPORTANT] Remove the local
(
for example, en-us
    )
    from the URL when you 
share it. If you include the locale 
in the link, the user will be forced 
into that locale experience and will have to
manually switch back to their 
preferred locale

to share. From the title section, select

## Copy a collection

You can copy any of your collections if you like
to use the same content in multiple collections or use one of your collections as a template for creating a new one. Copying a collection creates a new collection with the same title,

    content as needed. Any edits to the new collection wont affect the original collection.
1. Navigate to the collection

1. Select the **Delete** button from the header section of the collection.

 collection 
(
for example, modules, events, certifications
) will appear in the collection viewer's preferred language if that content has been localized 
elsewhere on the site already. Further reading
