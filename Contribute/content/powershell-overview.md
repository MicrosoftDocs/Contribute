# How to contribute to PowerShell documentation

The contributor guide is a collection of articles that explain the tools and processes we use to create documentation at Microsoft. Some of these guides cover information that is common to any documentation set published to Microsoft technical documentation. Some of the guides are specific to how we write documentation for PowerShell.

The common articles are available in this centralized contributor guide. The
[PowerShell contributor guide](/powershell/scripting/community/contributing/overview) is available in the community section of the PowerShell documentation.
