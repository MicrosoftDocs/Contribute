# How to contribute to PowerShell documentation

The PowerShell documentation uses the same basic style rules and processes as other Microsoft
technical documentation. The _PowerShell-Docs Contributor Guide_ includes specific guidelines and
processes that are unique to PowerShell content.

For more information, see the [PowerShell contributor guide][01] is available in the public
PowerShell documentation. Pay special attention to the following sections:

- [Markdown best practices][03]
- [PowerShell-Docs style guide][04]
- [Editorial checklist][02]
