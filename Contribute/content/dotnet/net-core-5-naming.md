# How to refer to .NET in docs

This article is mostly concerned with naming for .NET Core and .NET 5 and later versions. For .NET Framework, it should be referred to as ".NET Framework" and not "the .NET Framework".

## Recommended terminology

**In doc title and first heading (h1):**

- ".NET" (without mention of 5 or Core)

**First reference in article text:**

- ".NET" for docs about Core/5+ that present it to people new to .NET.
- ".NET 5 (and .NET Core) and later versions" if needed to emphasize Core/5+ as a specific .NET implementation.

**Subsequent references:**

- ".NET" for docs that present Core/5+ to people new to .NET or where the reference to Core/5+ is clear in context.
- ".NET 5 and later versions" where necessary to differentiate Core/5+ from other .NET implementations.

**Notes:**

- Other options we considered:
  - ".NET 5 (and .NET Core 2.1/3.1) and later versions" – the Core version numbers seem unnecessary and make the phrase longer than it needs to be.
  - ".NET 5 and later versions (formerly known as .NET Core)" -- could lead to confusion in that "5 and later" seems to exclude 2.1-3.1.
  - ".NET 5 and later versions (including .NET Core 2.1-3.1)" – similar issue in that 2.1-3.1 sounds they should be among the "later versions"
  - ".NET 5+" is a shorter alternative to ".NET 5 and later versions", but there are concerns that it would not be universally understood.
- ".NET 5 and later versions" will remain an accurate description after version 6 and later versions are released. But eventually ".NET" will be understood to mean 5+ and we may be able to eliminate "5 and later versions" in some contexts.
