# Create and manage Microsoft Learn Collections

Microsoft Learn Collections is a feature available to anyone with a Microsoft Learn profile. Collections allow you to create curated lists of Microsoft Learn content to share with your followers. A collection can include documentation articles, training modules, learning paths, videos, code samples, and more.

With collections, you can:

- Bookmark useful content that you need to reference often.
- Bookmark interesting content that you don't have time to read right now and want to revisit later.
- Curate content to share with your employees, students, followers, or community. In this case, plan what content you'll save to the collection and how you'll organize it before you create it.

## Create a collection

You can create a collection from your profile page or from the content page of any Microsoft Learn item.

Before building your collection, be clear about its purpose and what action you want the viewers to take. Prepare the different elements of the collection ahead of time. Use a short, descriptive title that summarizes the topic covered in the collection. Add a description of what’s included in the collection so that the viewer understands its purpose and what action you’re suggesting they take by accessing the collection. You can edit the title and description of the collection at any time.

### Create a collection from your Microsoft Learn profile

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com).
1. Select your profile icon in the upper-right corner of the page, and choose **Profile**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/collections/profile.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Microsoft Learn home page with the profile dropdown menu displayed.":::

1. Select **Collections** from the menu on the left-hand side of the page.
1. Select **+New Collection** at the bottom of the list of collections.
1. In the pop-up box that appears, give your new collection a title and a description.

    :::image type="content" source="media/collections/create-collection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the create a collection screen.":::

1. Select **Create**. Your collection now appears in the list of collections on your profile page.

### Create a collection from a Microsoft Learn item

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com).
1. Navigate to the Microsoft Learn content you want to add to a collection. Look for the **+Add** or **+** button.

    - For a **training module** or **learning path**, the button appears near the bottom of the title section:<br>

        :::image type="content" source="media/collections/create-module.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add button on a learning path.":::<br>

    - For an **article**, the button appears to the right of the title:<br>

        :::image type="content" source="media/collections/create-article.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add button on an article.":::<br>

    - For a **code sample**, the button appears on the **Browse code samples** page, at the bottom of each search result:<br>

        :::image type="content" source="media/collections/create-code-samples.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add button on code samples.":::<br>

1. In the pop-up box that appears, select **+New Collection**. Give your new collection a title and a description. Select **Submit**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/collections/create-from-item.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the create a collection window.":::

1. You'll be returned to the previous pop-up screen, where the collection you just created is now selected. Choose **Save** to add the content you're viewing to the new collection. You can select more items from the list to add the content to multiple collections.

    :::image type="content" source="media/collections/add-to-collection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add to a collection window.":::

1. A confirmation message appears at the top of the screen confirming the item has been added to the collection you just created.

## Add and manage content

The Collections feature supports all content types. Once you've created a collection, you can add any content from the Microsoft Learn site to the collection by selecting the **Save** button available on all pages. Once added, you can [rearrange](#rearrange-content) and [delete](#delete-content) content as needed.

Other considerations for adding content to a collection include:

- Limit the number of items in the collection to fewer than 10 items. Three to five items is ideal.
- The first item will get the most engagement, followed by positions two and three.
- The items in positions four through ten will receive more engagement if the sections are used.
- Sort sections and items in the order you recommend the user consume them.

### Add content to a collection

1. Make sure you're signed in to Microsoft Learn.
1. Navigate to the Microsoft Learn content you want to add to a collection. Look for the **+Add** or **+** button. For examples of how this button appears for various content types, see Step 2 in [Create a collection from a Microsoft Learn item](#create-a-collection-from-a-microsoft-learn-item).
1. The *Add to a collection* pop-up box appears. Select the collection(s) you'd like to add the content to.
1. Select **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/collections/add-to-collection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the add to a collection window.":::

### Rearrange content

When you add content to a collection, it's added to the bottom of the list. You can reorder content by using the **up/down** arrows on the content item, moving it one space at a time. Wait until each individual move interaction completes before selecting the **up/down** arrows again.

### Delete content

To delete content within a collection, select the **trash can** icon on the content item. A pop-up appears alerting you that the content will be permanently deleted. Select **Yes, delete** to delete the content.

## Add and manage sections

Once you've saved content to your collection, you can add sections to the collection to make it easier to navigate. You can add as many sections as you need. You can also move content items between sections, and you can [rearrange sections](#rearrange-sections) within the collection. And if you need to reorganize, you can [delete sections](#delete-sections) from the collection.

### Add sections to a collection

1. Select your profile icon in the upper-right corner of the page, and choose **Profile**.
1. Choose **Collections** from the menu on the left-hand side of the page.
1. Select the name of the collection you want to add sections to.
1. Under the list of content, select **Section**.
    :::image type="content" source="media/collections/add-section.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Section button in the collection page.":::
1. Add a section title that describes the content included in the section. For example:
    - Join the Microsoft Learn Cloud Skills Challenge
    - Access Azure Arc Learning Content
    - Find your certification pathway to Azure Virtual Desktop
    - Watch training videos for Azure Virtual Desktop

    This field is optional. If you don't add a title, the section will be named **Section 1** by default. You can change the title at any time.
1. Add a short description of the resources included in the section that directs the user to a specific action. For example:
    - Learn how to do more with less on Azure when you migrate to the cloud.
    - Optimize your investment and reinvest for growth.
    - Complete the following Microsoft Learn modules to gain skills and start implementing Azure Virtual Desktop in your company.

    This field is optional. You can change the description at any time.
1. Select **Save**.

### Rearrange sections

To rearrange a section, select the **up/down** arrows on the section header.

To rearrange content within the sections, select the **up/down** arrows on the content items. You can move content into and within your various sections. 

You can move items one space at a time. Wait until each individual move interaction completes before selecting the **up/down** arrows again. 

### Delete sections

To delete a section, select the **edit pencil** icon on the section header, and then select **Delete section**.

Deleting the section doesn't delete the content within the section. The content within the deleted section will move up to the section above it, if one exists.

## Share a collection

Sharing a collection with your followers or colleagues allows you to show others the content you've curated. You can share a collection with anyone, even if they don't have a Microsoft Learn account.

You can share your collection by copying the URL from the browser, or by using the *Share* functionality from within the collection itself.

### Share from the browser

1. Navigate to the collection you'd like to share.
1. Copy the link in the URL bar of your browser.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remove the local (for example, en-us) from the URL when you share it. If you include the locale in the link, the user will be forced into that locale experience and will have to manually switch back to their preferred locale.

### Share from the collection

1. Navigate to the collection you'd like to share.
1. From the title section, select **Share**, and then select the platform you'd like to share on. You can choose between Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, or email. You'll navigate to the platform you selected, where you can add a message to your post. The link to the collection will be automatically added to your post.

## Copy a collection

You can copy any of your collections if you'd like to use the same content in multiple collections or use one of your collections as a template for creating a new one. Copying a collection creates a new collection with the same title, content, and sections as the original collection. You can then add, remove, and rearrange content as needed. Any edits to the new collection won't affect the original collection.

1. Navigate to the collection you'd like to copy.
1. Select the **Copy** button from the header section of the collection.
1. A pop-up message appears alerting you that a copy of the collection has been saved to your profile. Select **Edit my collection** to see the new copy of the collection.

    :::image type="content" source="media/collections/copy-collection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the copy a collection button.":::

## Delete a collection

You can delete any of your collections. Deleting a collection is a permanent action that will also delete any content you've added to the collection and any sections you've created within the collection.

1. Navigate to the collection you'd like to delete.
1. Select the **Delete** button from the header section of the collection.
1. A pop-up message appears asking you to confirm the deletion. Select **Yes, delete** to permanently delete the collection.

    :::image type="content" source="media/collections/delete-collection.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the delete a collection button.":::

## Limitations

- Collections can include only content on Microsoft Learn. You can't add external links. Only Official Collections created by Microsoft employees can include links to resources outside of Microsoft Learn.

## Localization

- The title, description, and section titles and descriptions will appear only in the language the creator provides.
- The pieces of content added to the collection (for example, modules, events, certifications) will appear in the collection viewer's preferred language if that content has been localized elsewhere on the site already.
