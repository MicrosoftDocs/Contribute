- **Making a large contribution**. For instance, you might make contributions (additions, changes, or deletions) that span multiple articles and need to be committed and tested as one unit of work in a single pull request.
- **Creating and publishing a new article**, which typically requires a more robust local editor.
- **Adding new images or updating images**, which typically requires simultaneous creation of a new `media` subdirectory, image files, updates to image links in articles, and previewing markdown files in a local editor to test image rendering.
- **Updating an article over a period of days before you publish**. In these cases, you typically need to do regular integration of other changes that occur in the main branch. This integration is easier via Git Bash and local editing. You also run the risk of losing your edits if you do this via the GitHub UI and wait before you commit the changes.
- **Making continual updates to the same article after a pull request has been opened** (unless you are comfortable doing this via the GitHub UI). Using the GitHub UI has the potential to create multiple outstanding pull requests for the same file, which may conflict with one another.
