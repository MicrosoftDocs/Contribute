# GitHub account setup

To contribute to Microsoft Docs technical content, you need to set up your own GitHub account. The good news is, you usually only have to perform these steps once.

## Create a GitHub account

If you don't already have a GitHub account, [create one](https://github.com/signup). To learn more about creating a GitHub account, see Github's [Signing up for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/get-started/signing-up-for-github/) documentation.

## Set up your GitHub profile

Navigate to **Your profile** and then at the left of the page select **Edit profile**.

While not required, we recommend filling out the rest of your profile. You can add any affiliations, like organizations or University, to your bio. GitHub also provides a separate field for adding your employer. Once you are finished, select **Save**. For more information on customizing your GitHub profile, see GitHub's [Customizing your profile](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile) documentation.

Contributions to [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com) count toward [MVP award](https://mvp.microsoft.com) consideration. Identification helps us build a complete profile of all your activities.

>[!NOTE]
> Microsoft employees participating in Open Source projects always identify themselves as such in their GitHub profiles. Community contributors should ensure that their profile does not incorrectly imply an employment relationship.

## Next steps

In this step, you created a GitHub account and set up your profile. In the next step, you will install Git, Visual Studio Code, and more.
