# [Overview and browser based tasks](index.md)

  <!--
    This new page will include most of the content from
    the current index.md, and the first three sections from
    how-to-contribute.md (excluding writing new samples,
    and creating new content.)
   -->
## Larger scale changes

   <!--
     This page introduces the process to work locally on
     your own machine, following github flow. 

     Content will be taken from the last two sections of 
     how-to-contribute.md (writing new samples, and creating new content)
     and the how-to-write-workflows-major.md)
   -->
### Setup and clone source

   <!--
      This page will guide folks through the setup process
      through cloning the repo.

      It will have condensed versions of get-started-setup-github,
      get-started-setup-tools, and get-started-setup-local.

   -->

### Git and GitHub essentials

   <!-- 
      Explain the basics of Git and GitHub, and the GitHub flow
      process.

      Much, or all of this will be from full-workflow, and git-github-fundamentals

      The full list of repos probably doesn't belong here.
   -->

## Contribute new content

   <!-- 
     Primarily new content, but will include the content from the
     how-to-write-use-markdown, style-quick-start and how-to-write-links

     Process content will also be taken from how-to-contribute.
   -->

## Contribute new samples

   <!-- 
     Primarily new content, with some taken from how-to-contribute.

     This will also point to repo-specific guidance for samples.
   -->

## List of documentation repositories

   <!-- 
     This will take the list of repos from git-github-fundamentals
     for the public repositories.

     Open question: How to keep this up to date?
